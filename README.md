# hello-world
This is my first ever repository, let's see how this goes.

You ever had one of those moments when you just realized that there were some things about your daily routine you could change? Well, I had it three months ago and here I am, studying hard to become a developer and learning new things everyday. Hope one day I can bring something good to the community.
